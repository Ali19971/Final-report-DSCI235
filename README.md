# Babyhealth analysis using CTU-CHB Intrapartum Cardiotocography Database (DSCI235)

The Idea of figuring out the overall health of a newborn baby without any hardcore test is very fascinating in itself. It's a major issue in the medical field since the babies are so fragile we can not perform a lot of tests on them. SO the idea of this project is to come with a solution that can be used to conclude some important insights about the health of a newborn without doing a lot of tests on them.

We are going to address some very interesting and important analytical questions which will end up giving us very brief knowledge about the nature of the data, the hidden patterns in the dataset, and some really important relationships between various attributes and baby health.

To come up with some useful insights, I will be answering the following questions:

*   What is the average age of mothers for male and female babies?
*   What is the value under which 95% of the gestweeks would lie?
*   Identify the parity for most of the mothers?
*   Compare the mean and trimmed mean of age and comment on the presence of outliers. Back your answer up with a boxplot.
*   Find the percentage variation in age for the diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
*   Define a function to plot the categories of the rectype and find the category with the highest frequency
*   What is the probability of a male baby being healthy, find the same for the female baby.
*   Given that the mother is diabetic and the rectype is ultrasound find out if the health of the baby is good or not.
*   What are the chances for a baby to be healthy if the mother is not very young? Compare the result with the same of a young mother.
